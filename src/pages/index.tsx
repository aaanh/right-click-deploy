              Right-Click Deploy Manifesto
            </h1>
            <ol className="list-decimal">
              <li>
                We demand the right to deploy our code with a simple right-click,
                just like we demand the right to eat tacos on Tuesdays.
              </li>
              <li>
                We reject the notion that deployment should be a long and
                complicated process that requires sacrificing a goat under a full
                moon.
              </li>
              <li>
                We believe that deployment should be so easy that even your
                grandma can do it (assuming she knows how to use a computer).
              </li>
              <li>
                We refuse to accept that deployment should involve anything more
                than clicking a button and then sitting back with a cold beverage.
              </li>
              <li>
                We declare that any company that doesn&apos;t support Right-click
                Deploy is stuck in the past and is probably still using Internet
                Explorer.
              </li>
              <li>
                We propose that any developer who creates a deployment process
                that takes more than five minutes should be forced to wear a dunce
                cap for a week.
              </li>
              <li>
                We assert that deployment should be as easy as ordering a pizza
                (except without the greasy mess).
              </li>
              <li>
                We demand that any developer who creates a deployment process that
                involves a series of arcane commands and incantations be banished
                to a remote island (preferably one without Wi-Fi).
              </li>
              <li>
                We affirm that Right-click Deploy is not just a convenience, it&apos;s
                a way of life.
              </li>
              <li>
                We declare that anyone who opposes Right-click Deploy is an enemy
                of progress and is probably still using a flip phone.
              </li>
            </ol>
